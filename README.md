This repo contains:
- AYS blueprint [templates](/bootstrap/) to get yourself bootstrapped with a cockpit
- a configuration [servicetemplate](/bootstrap/servicetemplates/cockpit_configure) that:
    - makes sure the AYS `js8tests` repo exists on the cockpit
    - runs the js8t tests
- [js8tests](/js8tests/): an AYS repo which contains a recurring testing service

To get started, you first want to have a cockpit.
More information about how to do that [here](/bootstrap/README.md)
